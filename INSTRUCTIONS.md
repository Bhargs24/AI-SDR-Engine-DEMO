# AI SDR Engine - Public Repo Files

## What's in this folder

These files are designed for a **public GitHub showcase repository** - enough to demonstrate capabilities without giving away implementation details.

## Files to copy to public repo:

1. **README.md** - Main landing page (add your video link)
2. **FEATURES.md** - Detailed feature breakdown
3. **SCREENSHOTS.md** - Visual showcase (you'll need to add actual screenshots)

## What to do:

### 1. Create public repo
```bash
# On GitHub: Create new repository "AI-SDR-Engine-Demo" (public)
```

### 2. Take screenshots
Before making this private, capture:
- Launchpad form filled out
- Feed page with completed workflow
- Leads table with a lead selected
- ROI calculator page
- Message preview showing quality badge

Save to `screenshots/` folder in public repo

### 3. Record video
- Post your Loom/YouTube link in README.md
- Keep it to 2-3 minutes
- Show workflow but don't explain implementation

### 4. Copy files
```bash
# Copy these 3 files to your new public repo
README.md
FEATURES.md
SCREENSHOTS.md
```

### 5. Add to public README
At bottom, add:
```markdown
